# labryinth

## Description

Forget solving puzzles with your brain, solve puzzles with your muscles. We're solving the Labryinth maze using EMGs to control the x/y tilting of the puzzle. The EMGs will read a signal from each of the user's forearm muscles based on the user's flexing of the muscles. This signal will translate to x or y axis rotation performed by servo motors hooked up to the game.
